# 🧩 Maze Path Finder (DAA Project)

### 👨‍💻 Overview
This project demonstrates a Maze Path Finder built in C language using the Backtracking algorithm.
It finds a valid path from the start (0, 0) to the destination (n-1, n-1) in a maze represented as a 2D grid.
Each cell in the maze can either be a path (0) or a wall (1), and the program determines if an escape route exists.

| input.txt | Input maze matrix (0 for path, 1 for wall) |
| output_example.txt | Sample output generated by the program |
| screenshots/ | Folder containing screenshots of the output |
| README.md | Documentation for the project |

### 🧠 Algorithm Used: Backtracking (DFS Approach)
The algorithm explores the maze recursively:
1. Start from the top-left corner (0,0).
2. Move only through valid and unvisited cells.
3. If the destination is reached, mark the path.
4. If no path exists from a cell, backtrack and try another route.

**Pseudocode:**
solveMaze(x, y):
if (x, y) is destination:
mark cell as part of solution
return true
if (x, y) is safe to move:
mark cell as part of solution
if solveMaze(x+1, y): return true
if solveMaze(x, y+1): return true
if solveMaze(x-1, y): return true
if solveMaze(x, y-1): return true
unmark cell (backtrack)
return false

### ⚙️ How to Run
1. Open any C compiler (Code::Blocks, Dev C++, or OnlineGDB).
2. Place maze.c and input.txt in the same folder.
3. Compile and run the program.
4. The program will read the maze from input.txt and:
   - Print whether a path exists.
   - Show the visited cells and the solution path.

### ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity
| Case | Complexity | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Time (Worst) | O(4^(n²)) | Each cell can lead to up to 4 recursive calls |
| Space | O(n²) | Due to recursion stack and visited matrix |
